        Love and care for the people around us like Amy always did.<br> 
        Give each other hugs and let them know you love them and will <br>
        always be there for them no matter how obvious it may seem.<br>
        Care for one another selflessly, especially for those less fortunate than you.<br>
        Finally, smile. Amy had a smile that could light up the whole room and your whole life.<br>
        If we do these things every day, I know we will make Amy so proud <br>
        and she will be smiling on us every step of the way. <br> -Tim Lee
